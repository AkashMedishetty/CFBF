├── sw.js (service worker)
├── static/ (optimized assets)
├── icons/ (PWA icons)
└── apple-touch-icon.png (iOS support)

### Step 3: Server Configuration

#### Apache (.htaccess)
```apache
# Enable HTTPS redirect
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# SPA routing support
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]

# Service Worker MIME type
AddType application/javascript .js
AddType text/javascript .js

# PWA headers
<Files "manifest.json">
    Header set Content-Type "application/manifest+json"
</Files>

<Files "sw.js">
    Header set Content-Type "application/javascript"
    Header set Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
</Files>

# Security headers
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
```

#### Nginx
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    root /path/to/build;
    index index.html;
    
    # SPA routing
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    
    # Service Worker
    location /sw.js {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate";
        add_header Content-Type "application/javascript";
    }
    
    # PWA Manifest
    location /manifest.json {
        add_header Content-Type "application/manifest+json";
    }
    
    # Static assets caching
    location /static/ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
}
```

### Step 4: DNS and SSL Setup
