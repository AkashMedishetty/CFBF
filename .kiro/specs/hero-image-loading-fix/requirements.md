# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical image loading and layout issues in the hero section of the Blood Donation Management System. Users are experiencing problems with images not loading properly and poor layout presentation, which negatively impacts the first impression and user experience. The fix will ensure reliable image loading, proper fallback handling, and optimal layout across all devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the website, I want the hero section images to load reliably and quickly, so that I can see the visual content that supports the platform's messaging without delays or broken images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL load both blood donation images within 3 seconds on standard connections
2. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL display meaningful fallback content instead of broken image placeholders
3. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading indicators with skeleton screens
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL prioritize hero images for immediate loading without lazy loading delays
5. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shift by maintaining proper aspect ratios during loading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the hero section on different devices, I want the image layout to be visually appealing and properly structured, so that the content looks professional and engaging regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the hero section on desktop THEN the system SHALL display images in a balanced asymmetric layout that complements the text content
2. WHEN a user accesses the hero section on tablet THEN the system SHALL stack images appropriately while maintaining visual hierarchy
3. WHEN a user views the hero section on mobile THEN the system SHALL optimize image sizes and positioning for small screens
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper spacing, shadows, and visual depth effects
5. WHEN the layout renders THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent proportions and avoid overlapping or misaligned elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with a slow internet connection, I want the hero section to load gracefully with optimized images, so that I can access the content without excessive waiting times or bandwidth usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a slow connection THEN the system SHALL serve appropriately sized images based on device capabilities
2. WHEN images are being optimized THEN the system SHALL use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with proper fallbacks
3. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL implement progressive image enhancement
4. WHEN images load slowly THEN the system SHALL show meaningful placeholder content that doesn't break the layout
5. WHEN optimization fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard image formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the hero section, I want robust error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and resolve image loading issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN fallback images are used THEN the system SHALL track and report these occurrences
3. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and monitoring data
4. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error states and diagnostic information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user accessing the website, I want the hero section layout to be stable and not cause visual jumps or shifts, so that I have a smooth and professional browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL prevent cumulative layout shift (CLS) by reserving proper space for images
2. WHEN images load progressively THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent positioning of other elements
3. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't interfere with image loading or layout stability
4. WHEN responsive breakpoints change THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition layouts without jarring movements
5. WHEN content loads THEN the system SHALL maintain proper z-index layering and element positioning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the hero section images to be properly accessible with appropriate alternative text and loading states, so that I can understand the content regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive alt text that conveys the image content and context
2. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL announce loading states to screen readers
3. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful alternative content descriptions
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL ensure proper focus management during loading states
5. WHEN accessibility tools are used THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic structure and proper ARIA labels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the hero section, I want the images to enhance the overall design with proper styling and visual effects, so that the section looks polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL apply consistent border radius, shadows, and visual effects
2. WHEN users hover over images THEN the system SHALL provide subtle interactive feedback
3. WHEN images are positioned THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment with text content
4. WHEN visual effects are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't impact loading performance
5. WHEN the design renders THEN the system SHALL create visual depth and hierarchy through proper layering

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring the platform, I want reliable image delivery and performance metrics, so that I can ensure optimal user experience and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are served THEN the system SHALL track loading times and success rates
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to potential issues
3. WHEN users experience problems THEN the system SHALL collect diagnostic data for troubleshooting
4. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL measure and report performance improvements
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics on image delivery performance
