  - Ensure consistent aspect ratios across all breakpoints
  - Add proper CSS for shadows, border radius, and visual depth effects
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 4. Implement layout stability and prevent cumulative layout shift
  - Add proper aspect ratio containers to reserve space during loading
  - Implement skeleton loading screens that match final image dimensions
  - Ensure animations don't interfere with layout stability
  - Add smooth transitions between responsive breakpoints
  - Maintain proper z-index layering and element positioning
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 5. Enhance error handling and debugging capabilities
  - Add comprehensive error logging for image loading failures
  - Implement performance metrics tracking for load times and success rates
  - Create retry mechanisms with proper error state management
  - Add diagnostic information for debugging image loading issues
  - Implement fallback tracking and reporting for monitoring
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Improve accessibility and loading state communication
  - Add descriptive alt text that conveys image content and context
  - Implement proper ARIA labels for loading states and error conditions
  - Ensure screen readers announce loading progress and completion
  - Add keyboard navigation support during loading states
  - Maintain semantic structure throughout loading process
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 7. Apply consistent visual styling and interactive effects
  - Ensure consistent border radius, shadows, and visual effects across all images
  - Implement subtle hover effects that don't impact loading performance
  - Fix spacing and alignment between images and text content
  - Add proper visual depth and hierarchy through layering
  - Ensure visual effects work consistently across all device sizes
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 8. Implement performance monitoring and metrics collection
  - Add image loading time tracking and success rate monitoring
  - Implement real-time performance metrics collection
  - Create diagnostic data collection for troubleshooting
  - Add performance alerts for degraded image delivery
  - Ensure monitoring doesn't impact user experience or loading performance
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [ ] 9. Create fallback images and optimize image assets
  - Create appropriate fallback images for Blood Donation 1.jpg and Blood Donation 2.jpg
  - Optimize existing images for different formats (WebP, AVIF) and sizes
  - Implement responsive image serving based on device capabilities
  - Add generic medical placeholder images for complete failures
  - Ensure all fallback images maintain the same aspect ratios as originals
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 10. Test and validate image loading across different scenarios
  - Test image loading on slow network connections
  - Validate error handling when images are completely unavailable
  - Test responsive layout behavior across all device sizes
  - Verify accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
  - Measure and validate performance metrics (CLS, loading times, success rates)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 6.1, 8.1_
