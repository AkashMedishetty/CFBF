- **Micro-interactions**: Add subtle hover effects, loading states, and feedback animations
- **Typography**: Use consistent font scales with perfect readability and hierarchy
- **Iconography**: Implement Lucide React icons with consistent stroke weights and sizes
- **Color System**: Use semantic color tokens that adapt to light/dark themes
- **Spacing**: Follow 8px grid system for consistent spacing and alignment

### Animation Guidelines:
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth fade/slide transitions between routes (200-300ms)
- **Component Animations**: Subtle scale/fade effects for cards and buttons (150ms)
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators with smooth animations
- **Form Interactions**: Real-time validation feedback with color and icon changes
- **Hover Effects**: Gentle scale/shadow changes for interactive elements
- **Success States**: Celebration animations for completed actions (donations, registrations)

### Performance Considerations:
- **Lazy Loading**: Code-split routes and heavy components
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and lazy-load images with blur placeholders
- **Animation Optimization**: Use transform and opacity for smooth 60fps animations
- **Bundle Size**: Tree-shake unused code and optimize dependencies
- **Accessibility**: Support reduced motion preferences and keyboard navigation

### Component Quality Standards:
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with perfect tablet and desktop layouts
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and focus management
- **Error Handling**: Beautiful error states with helpful messaging and recovery options
- **Empty States**: Engaging empty states with illustrations and clear call-to-actions
