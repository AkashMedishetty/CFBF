# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical image loading and layout issues in the home page hero section of the Blood Donation Management System. Users are experiencing problems with images not loading properly and poor layout presentation, which negatively impacts the first impression and user experience. The fix will ensure reliable image loading, proper layout rendering, and optimal visual presentation across all devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the home page, I want the blood donation images to load reliably and display properly, so that I can see the visual content that supports the platform's mission and messaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL load both blood donation images (Blood Donation 1.jpg and Blood Donation 2.jpg) successfully within 3 seconds
2. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading placeholders or skeleton screens
3. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a meaningful fallback image or error state
4. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL display them with proper aspect ratios and without layout shifts
5. WHEN a user has a slow connection THEN the system SHALL progressively load images with blur-to-sharp transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the hero section on different devices, I want the layout to be visually appealing and properly structured, so that the content is easy to read and the images complement the text effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the hero section on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a balanced layout with proper spacing between text and images
2. WHEN a user views the hero section on tablet THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout to maintain visual hierarchy and readability
3. WHEN a user views the hero section on mobile THEN the system SHALL stack elements appropriately without overlapping or crowding
4. WHEN the layout renders THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent margins, padding, and alignment across all breakpoints
5. WHEN content loads THEN the system SHALL prevent cumulative layout shift (CLS) scores above 0.1

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the hero section, I want the images to be properly optimized and responsive, so that they load quickly and look crisp on my device without consuming excessive bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are served THEN the system SHALL provide WebP format for modern browsers with JPEG fallbacks
2. WHEN a user accesses the site on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL serve appropriately sized images using responsive image techniques
3. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for non-critical images to improve initial page load
4. WHEN a user has a high-DPI display THEN the system SHALL serve higher resolution images for crisp display
5. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain optimal file sizes without sacrificing visual quality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the images to have proper alternative text and be accessible to screen readers, so that I can understand the visual content regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL include descriptive alt text that conveys the meaning and context of each image
2. WHEN a screen reader encounters images THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful descriptions that support the blood donation narrative
3. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL ensure alt text is still available and informative
4. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL ensure images don't interfere with focus management
5. WHEN images are decorative THEN the system SHALL mark them appropriately to avoid screen reader confusion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the hero section, I want the image loading and layout code to be robust and maintainable, so that future updates can be made efficiently without breaking the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing image loading THEN the system SHALL use error boundaries to prevent component crashes
2. WHEN handling image states THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading, success, and error state management
3. WHEN styling layouts THEN the system SHALL use consistent CSS classes and avoid inline styles where possible
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging for troubleshooting
5. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing props and interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on a slow or unreliable internet connection, I want the hero section to gracefully handle network issues, so that I can still access the core content even if images don't load perfectly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL prioritize text content loading over images
2. WHEN images timeout during loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback content without breaking the layout
3. WHEN a user is on a metered connection THEN the system SHALL respect data-saving preferences if available
4. WHEN retrying failed image loads THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server
5. WHEN images partially load THEN the system SHALL handle incomplete downloads gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a stakeholder monitoring the platform's performance, I want the hero section to meet performance benchmarks, so that we maintain fast loading times and good user experience metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring page performance THEN the system SHALL achieve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores under 2.5 seconds
2. WHEN tracking layout stability THEN the system SHALL maintain Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) scores under 0.1
3. WHEN monitoring image loading THEN the system SHALL achieve 95% successful load rates across all devices
4. WHEN analyzing user experience THEN the system SHALL maintain Core Web Vitals scores in the "Good" range
5. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL work efficiently on devices with limited processing power

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user viewing the hero section, I want the visual design to be polished and professional, so that I trust the platform and feel confident about using the blood donation service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images display THEN the system SHALL show them with appropriate shadows, borders, or styling effects
2. WHEN the layout renders THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy and spacing
3. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth transitions without jarring movements
4. WHEN colors are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
5. WHEN the overall design is viewed THEN the system SHALL create a cohesive and professional appearance that builds trust
