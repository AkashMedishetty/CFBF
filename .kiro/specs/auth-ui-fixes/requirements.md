# Authentication and UI Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Blood Donation Management System has several critical issues that are preventing proper user experience and functionality. Based on the user's feedback, the following problems need immediate resolution:

1. **Authentication Context Issues**: Users are being repeatedly authenticated (excessive auth checks) but the authentication state is not being properly stored or displayed in the UI
2. **Navigation Bar Issues**: Sign-in and register buttons remain visible even after successful login, and user information is not displayed
3. **Health Questionnaire UI Problems**: Checkboxes in the medical conditions section are not visible
4. **Mobile Menu Issues**: Mobile hamburger menu opens and closes too quickly, making it unusable
5. **Onboarding Issues**: Medication section needs to be removed from the onboarding flow
6. **Missing Awards Section**: Need to add a comprehensive awards section to the About Us page
7. **Contact Page Cleanup**: Remove Emergency Hotline and Our Offices sections

These issues are affecting user experience and preventing the system from functioning as intended.
