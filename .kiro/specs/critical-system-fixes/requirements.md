# Critical System Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Blood Donation Management System is experiencing several critical issues that are preventing proper functionality and user experience. Based on the error logs and user feedback, the following problems require immediate resolution:

1. **Onboarding Loop Issue**: Even after admin approval, users are stuck in the onboarding screen and see "session expired" messages
2. **Navigation Display Issue**: The navigation bar shows email instead of the user's name
3. **Mobile Menu Collapse Issue**: The mobile hamburger menu opens and closes instantly, making it unusable
4. **Export Functionality Broken**: Admin donor export is failing with JSON parsing errors
5. **Audit Logger Error**: The audit logging system has a missing function error
6. **Authentication State Issues**: Multiple API calls to /auth/me causing performance issues
7. **Framer Motion Animation Warnings**: Animation errors causing console warnings

These issues are critical for system functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

5. WHEN the system checks my approval status THEN it SHALL use the most current data from the database
6. WHEN I complete onboarding and get approved THEN the system SHALL immediately update my session to reflect approved status
7. WHEN I am in an approved state THEN the system SHALL never show onboarding screens or approval pending messages

3. WHEN I tap outside the mobile menu area THEN the menu SHALL close smoothly
4. WHEN I tap the hamburger icon again while the menu is open THEN the menu SHALL close with proper animation
5. WHEN the mobile menu opens or closes THEN the animations SHALL be smooth without flickering or instant collapse
6. WHEN I navigate to a new page from the mobile menu THEN the menu SHALL close automatically
7. WHEN I rotate my device THEN the mobile menu SHALL maintain proper functionality and appearance

### Requirement 4: Fix Admin Export Functionality

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to export donor data to Excel/CSV format successfully, so that I can generate reports and analyze donor information for administrative purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the export button THEN the system SHALL generate the export file without JSON parsing errors
2. WHEN the export is processing THEN the system SHALL show proper loading indicators and progress feedback
3. WHEN the export completes THEN the system SHALL automatically download the file with proper formatting
4. WHEN I export donor data THEN the file SHALL contain all relevant donor information in a readable format
5. WHEN the export fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and recovery options
6. WHEN I export large datasets THEN the system SHALL handle the process efficiently without timeout errors
7. WHEN the export file is generated THEN it SHALL be properly formatted as CSV or Excel with appropriate headers
8. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL log the export action properly without audit logger errors

### Requirement 5: Fix Audit Logging System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all admin actions to be properly logged for audit purposes, so that we can maintain compliance and track system usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log them without "logger.audit is not a function" errors
2. WHEN audit logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue functioning but log the audit failure appropriately
3. WHEN I perform admin actions THEN the audit logs SHALL capture user ID, action type, timestamp, and relevant details
4. WHEN audit logs are created THEN they SHALL be stored persistently and be retrievable for compliance purposes
5. WHEN the audit logger encounters errors THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without breaking the main functionality
6. WHEN I export data or manage donors THEN these actions SHALL be properly audited with complete information

### Requirement 6: Optimize Authentication API Calls

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the authentication system to work efficiently without excessive API calls, so that the system performs well and provides a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL not make excessive calls to /api/v1/auth/me
2. WHEN my authentication state is already known THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of making new API requests
3. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL batch authentication checks efficiently
4. WHEN authentication data is fetched THEN it SHALL be cached appropriately with reasonable expiration times
5. WHEN I stay on the same page THEN the system SHALL not repeatedly call authentication endpoints
6. WHEN authentication tokens are valid THEN the system SHALL not make unnecessary verification requests

### Requirement 7: Fix Framer Motion Animation Issues
